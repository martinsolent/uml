# Tools and Platforms

There are a number of diagram software packages and platforms, ideally you need to pick one you are comfortable using or fits in with your organisation. Ideally picking one that can create diagrams by scripting which will help the process be less awkward and time consuming.

You can also get Live Editor platforms such as Mermaid and use AI to help you scaffold the basic structure using prompts in ChatGTP plus plugins for editors such as VS Code.
